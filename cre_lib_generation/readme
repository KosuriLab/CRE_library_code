Directory contains all materials required to generate the CRE library. 

CRE library generation ran with cre_lib.py using cre_controls, enhancer_templates, fwd_primers_cre, and rev_primers_cre

Output is cre_lib_final.csv, of which was sent for synthesis.

cre_lib_final.csv is used in BCmap for generating BC-variant associations. cre_lib_final_2_4.csv is subset from this and contains 
corresponding to the single CRE library and another library that was not analyzed in this MPRA. cre_lib_final_3_5_c.csv corresponds 
to variants in the CRE Spacing and Distance library and Number and Affinity library.
